# Digital Platform for Continuing Education

As part of the [Tech4Germany fellowship](https://tech4germany.org), we worked on a prototype of a platform for continuing education together with the German [Federal Minstry of Labor and Social Affairs](https://www.bmas.de/EN/Home) as part of the [National Continuing Education Strategy 2021](https://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news-and-press/news/germany-new-national-continuing-education-strategy).

Using user-centered and agile methods such as design thinking and Scrum, we developed this prototype for a central entry platform for continiung edication in Germany. This entry platform solves the biggest obstacles for citizens in finding a suitable education opportunity for them: The platform brings together all information relevant for a decision on continuing education in one place and at the same time offers a playful opportunity for orientation and self-assesment using machine learning.

The prototype was developed with the continuous involvement of stakeholders and user feedback and forms the basis for improved and more motivating user experience for citizens on their way to lifelong learning.
